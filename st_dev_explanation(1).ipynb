    "This experiment demonstrates the practical impact of Bessel's correction (n−1n−1) in the sample standard deviation formula. It highlights how sample size affects the accuracy of statistical estimators:\n",
    "\n",
    "    For smaller samples, the correction is more important, as n−1n−1 consistently outperforms nn.\n",
    "    For larger samples, the difference diminishes, and nn performs almost as well as n−1n−1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This aligns with statistical theory: as sample size increases, the bias corrected by n−1n−1 becomes negligible because (n−1)/n→1(n−1)/n→1."
